Binary information in digital computers is stored in memory or processor 
registers. Registers contain either data or control information. Control information Is a bit or a group of bits used to specify the sequence of command signals 
needed for manipulation of the data iJ'I other registers. Data are numbers and 
other binary-<:oded information that are operated on to achieve required computational results. In this chapter we present the most common types of data 
found in digital compute.rs and show how the various data types are represented in binary-<:oded form iJ'I computer registers. 
The data types found iJ'I the registers of digital computers may be classified as beirlg one of the foUowing categories: {1) numbers used in arithmetic 
computations, (2) letters of the alphabet used in data processing. and {3) other 
discrete symbols used for specific purposes. All types of data, except binary 
numbers, are represented in computer registers in binary<Oded form. This is 
because registers are made up of flip-flops and flip-flops are two-state devires 
that can store only l's and O's. The binary number system is the most natural 
system to 
differe
use in a digital computer. But sometimes it is convenient to employ 
nt number systems, espedally the decimal number system, since it is 
used by people to perform arithmetic computations.

Number Systems 
A number system of base, or radix, r is a system that uses distinct symbols for 
r digits. Numbers are represented by a string of digit symbols. To determine 
the quantity that the number represents, it is necessary to multiply each digit 
by an integer power of r and then form the sum of all weighted digits. For 
example, the decimal number system in everyday use employs the radix 10 
system. The 10 symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The string of digits 
724.5 is interpreted to represent the quantity 
7 X 102 + 2 X 101 + 4 X 10° + 5 X 10-1 
that is, 7 hundreds, plus 2 tens, plus 4 units, plus 5 tenths. Every decimal 
number can be similarly interpreted to find the quantity it represents. 
The binary number system uses the radix 2. The two digit symbols used 
are 0 and 1. The string of digits 101101 is interpreted to represent the quantity 
1 x�+Ox�+ 1 x �+1x�+Ox�+1 x�=e 
To distinguish between different radix numbers, the digits will be enclosed in 
parentheses and the radix of the number inserted as a subscript. For example, 
to show the equality between decimal and binary forty-five we will write 
(101101), = (45)w. 
Besides the decimal and binary number systems, the octal (radix 8) and 
hexadecimal (radix 16) are important in digital computer work. The eight symbols of the octal system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The 16 symbols of the 
hexadecimal system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, 0, E, and F. The last 
six symbols are, unfortunately, identical to the letters of the alphabet and can 
cause confusion at times. However, this is the convention that has been 
adopted. When used to represent hexadecimal digits, the symbols A, B, C, D, 
E, F correspond to the decimal numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, respectively. 
A number in radix r can be converted to the familiar decimal system by 
forming the sum of the weighted digits. For example, octal 736.4 is converted 
to decimal as follows: 
(736.4), = 7 X 82 + 3 X 8
1 + 6 X 8° + 4 X 8-I 
= 7 X 64 + 3 X 8 + 6 X 1 + 4/8 = (478.5)1
0 
The equivalent decimal number of hexadecimal F3 is obtained from the following calculation: 
(F3)J6 = F X 16 + 3 = 15 X 16 + 3 = (243)10 
Conversion from decimal to its equivalent representation in the radix r system 
is carried out by separating the number into its integer and fraction parts and 
SECTION 3-1 Data Types 69 
converting each part separately. The conversion of a decimal integer into a base 
r representation is done by successive divisions by r and accumulation of the 
remainders. The conversion of a decimal fraction to radix r representation is 
accomplished by successive multiplications by r and accumulation of the integer digits so obtained. Figure 3-1 demonstrates these procedures. 
The conversion of decimal 4L6875 into binary is done by first separating 
the number into its integer part 41 and fraction part .6875. The integer part is 
converted by dividing 41 by r = 2 to give an integer quotient of 20 and a 
remainder of L The quotient is again divided by 2 to give a new quotient and 
remainder. This process is repeated until the integer quotient becomes 0. The 
coefficients of the binary number are obtained from the remainders with the 
first remainder giving the low-order bit of the converted binary number. 
The fraction part is converted by multiplying it by r = 2 to give an integer 
and a fraction. The new fraction (without the integer) is multiplied again by 2 
to give a new integer and a new fraction. This process is repeated until the 
fraction part becomes zero or until the number of digits obtained gives the 
required accuracy. The coefficients of the binary fraction are obtained from 
the integer digits with the first integer computed being the digit to be placed 
next to the binary point. Finally, the two parts are combined to give the total 
required conversion.
